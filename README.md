Grails 2.0 prototype of a social web application.

Developed by Ren√© Puchinger in 2013 under Apache 2.0 license (see the file LICENSE).

Features
--------

The purpose of this demo application is to evaluate the web application framework Grails. This results mainly from my personal interests and from my needs to be more effective. The current version is by no means intended as a fully featured social networking site.

For more information about Grails framework you can visit http://www.grails.org

Here are some features of this demo:

- Simple community/social web aplication developed in Grails 2.0.4.
- Responsive layout using Bootstrap, HTML5 and CSS3 enabling user experience on different view devices (try to resize the browser window width!).
- Login, Logout, Registration with email confirmation, Lost password, Reset password by means of Spring Security.
- Distinguished roles of anonymous, regular and administrator users.
- Approximate displaying of time using Pretty Time.
- Administration of users, roles and other security info.
- Possibility to "follow" other users by means of AJAX.
- Modal dialog to edit user profile.
- Uploading user image in AJAX way.
- Recaptcha integration to help avoid spam.
- Scaffolded, but customized administration of underlying entities.

Instructions
------------

- Install **Grails SDK** version 2.0.4

- Download **commshare** source code from github to your local folder:

  git clone https://github.com/renp/commshare.git

- Run unit and integration tests

  grails test-app
	
- Run and test the app locally

  grails run-app

After this command finishes, you can point your browser to http://localhost:8080/commshare

The application uses SendGrid for sending e-mails to confirm new account creation. Hence on localhost the user registration
process will not work immediately -- SendGrid has to be configured. The most convenient way to create test accounts in 
development environment is to add them in BootStrap.groovy manually.

To run the application in production environment, one needs to change few settings in grails-app/conf/ directory. These settings
are by default obtained as environment variables and include configuration for Database parameters, SendGrid account and ReCaptcha account.
